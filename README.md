Pull requests are welcome.


Use at your own risk, although I have proved that it works.

#Usage
* find a machine with bash prompt (e.g. Macbook Pro, Macbook Air and iMac)
* download check.sh and parse.py
* cd to the file dir, type the following commands
```
chmod 744 check.sh

./check.sh
```
* enjoy! If phones are available, it will list them out.
