Pull requests are welcome.


Use at your own risk, although I have proved that it works.

#Usage
1. find a *inux machine (e.g. Mac, Mac and Mac)
2. download check.sh and parse.py
3. cd to the file dir, type the following commands
```
chmod 744 check.sh

./check.sh
```
4. enjoy! If phones are available, it will list them out.
